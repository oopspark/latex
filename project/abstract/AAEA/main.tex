\noindent\textbf{Motivation and Relevance.}

Structural change in global grain trade has gained renewed attention in the context
of repeated geopolitical shocks, supply chain disruptions, and rising concerns
over food security.
Previous studies of international grain markets have primarily relied on
network indicators based on single commodities or aggregate trade volumes.
While such measures capture changes in trade intensity,
they provide limited information on how the internal composition of bilateral
trade relationships evolves over time.
By abstracting from the multi-commodity nature of trade flows,
existing approaches often fail to distinguish structural reconfiguration
from proportional scaling of trade volumes.

Recent disruptions illustrate this limitation.
Adjustments in global grain markets frequently occur through reallocations
across commodities and trading partners within established trade relationships,
rather than through uniform contractions or expansions of total trade.
This study addresses the need for a measure that captures such compositional
adjustments in a systematic and comparable manner.

\noindent\textbf{Methodology.}

The global grain trade system is represented as a sequence of weighted,
directed adjacency matrices constructed from FAOSTAT bilateral trade data
from the late 1980s onward.
For each year $t$, the trade relationship between importing country $i$
and exporting country $j$ is described by a four-dimensional vector
\[
\mathbf{x}_{ij,t}
= (x^{\text{wheat}}_{ij,t}, x^{\text{soy}}_{ij,t},
   x^{\text{maize}}_{ij,t}, x^{\text{rice}}_{ij,t}),
\]
where each element denotes the import quantity of a major grain commodity.
The collection of these vectors forms a vector-valued adjacency matrix
$\mathbf{X}_t$, summarizing the multi-commodity structure of global grain trade
in year $t$.

Structural change between years $t-1$ and $t$ is measured at the link level.
Changes in commodity composition are captured by the intertemporal angle
$\theta_{ij,t}$ between $\mathbf{x}_{ij,t-1}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{ij,t}$,
\[
\theta_{ij,t}
= \arccos\!\left(
\frac{\mathbf{x}_{ij,t-1}\cdot \mathbf{x}_{ij,t}}
{\lVert \mathbf{x}_{ij,t-1} \rVert \, \lVert \mathbf{x}_{ij,t} \rVert}
\right).
\]
To reflect the economic importance of each link,
this angular change is weighted by the norm of the previous-year vector
$\lVert \mathbf{x}_{ij,t-1} \rVert$,
yielding a link-level structural change measure
\[
m_{ij,t} = \lVert \mathbf{x}_{ij,t-1} \rVert \, \theta_{ij,t}.
\]
Aggregating across all country pairs produces an annual global index
\[
D_t = \left( \sum_{i,j} m_{ij,t}^2 \right)^{1/2},
\]
which corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the matrix of link-level changes.
This formulation allows the global index to be decomposed into bilateral
contributions without loss of information.

\noindent\textbf{Empirical Patterns.}

Figure~\ref{fig:global_index} plots the evolution of the global structural
change index $D_t$ over time.
The index exhibits substantial variation, with distinct peaks corresponding
to periods of major reorganization in global grain trade.



In the late 1980s, structural change increases markedly alongside broader
transformations in the international political and economic environment.
A limited number of large bilateral relationships—particularly those involving
the United States, the former Soviet Union (USSR), Japan, and Algeria—
account for a substantial share of the observed change.
These contributions are associated with shifts in commodity composition
within existing trade links rather than the formation of new ones.

After a relatively stable period in the 2000s,
structural change rises again in the early 2020s.
In contrast to earlier episodes, the peak observed in 2023 is dominated
by commodity-specific reorientation within a small number of links.
Table~\ref{tab:top_links} shows that China’s maize imports from Brazil
constitute the single largest contribution to global structural change in that year.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Top contributing bilateral links to structural change}
\label{tab:top_links}
\begin{tabular}{l l l r}
\hline
Year & Importer & Exporter & Contribution \\
\hline
2023 & China & Brazil & --- \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This pattern suggests that recent structural change reflects a reallocation
of sourcing strategies by major importers rather than a generalized disruption
of global trade.

\noindent\textbf{Interpretation and Discussion.}

Weighting angular change by the magnitude of the previous-year trade vector
plays a central role in the interpretation of the index.
If structural change were measured solely by angular variation,
reconfigurations among small trade links would receive the same weight
as those occurring within large-scale relationships.
By scaling the intertemporal angle by lagged trade volume,
the measure assigns greater importance to adjustments within
economically significant links.

Domestic production and self-sufficiency are excluded from the diagonal
elements of the adjacency matrix.
This restriction keeps the interpretation of $D_t$ focused on
international trade reconfiguration rather than overall supply adjustment.
Future extensions may incorporate domestic production as a separate layer,
allowing joint analysis of trade dependence and self-sufficiency.
